[This is some discussion.
Here I can link my results to the vision that was presented in the introduction, are the results good enough for some of those applications? Are those scenarios plausible according to my findings? what could be done with my system, more than what has been done? How could one take my work and use it for other purposes, or expand it? how to make it faster?]
